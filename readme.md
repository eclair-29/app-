## The Skuld Builder v.1.0.0

An intermediate and transitional project workflow environment made by the [Skuld Project](www.facebook.com/miguel.dechavez.3)
for starting your development project. The folder structure consists of a build system, 
development folder and production folder. Content Files for each folder are divided
according to the process folder (either development or production) in order to 
handle your project smoothly.
